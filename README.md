It's a deep dive into both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies, providing me with the skills needed to become a **Full Stack Developer**.

### What You‚Äôll Find Here:
- **JavaScript Fundamentals (JS)** - Covering core concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and more.
- **TypeScript** - A superset of JavaScript, teaching static typing, interfaces, classes, and more advanced concepts.
- **Node.js & Express** - Back-end technologies for building REST APIs, handling requests, and interacting with databases.
- **React.js** - Building dynamic front-end applications, using React hooks, Redux, and state management.
- **Database Management** - Working with **SQL (MySQL/MariaDB)** and **NoSQL (MongoDB)** databases, including queries, relationships, and schema modeling.
- **Web Security** - Implementing authentication, session management, and JWT-based login systems.
- **Deployment** - Deploying applications on a Linux server, setting up SSL certificates, and continuous deployment with GitHub and Google Cloud.
- **Testing** - Writing automated tests using **Jest** to ensure quality and reliability of applications.
- **Design Patterns** - Learning and applying classic **GoF design patterns** to write clean, maintainable code.
